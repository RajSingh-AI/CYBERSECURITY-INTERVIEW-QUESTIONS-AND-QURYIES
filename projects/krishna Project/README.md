1. **Setting Up the Environment**:
   - The code begins by setting up the Turtle graphics window (`wn`) with specific properties:
     - Dimensions: 768x768 pixels.
     - Title: "Raj Mahesh - RadhaKrishna."
     - Background color: Dark gray (#444444).
   - It imports the `turtle` library and sets up the screen for drawing.

2. **Drawing Radha's Face and Features** (`b` Turtle):
   - Radha's face and features are drawn meticulously.
   - The turtle `b` is used to draw these features.
   - Radha's eyes, nose, and mouth are carefully created using various shapes, angles, and line widths (`pensize`). These features are drawn using both circular and linear movements.
   - The hair, the decorative pottu (a mark on the forehead), and the jewelry are also intricately crafted.
   - The drawing of Radha is incredibly detailed, with careful attention to lines and shapes to represent the deity's characteristics.

3. **Drawing Krishna's Face and Features** (`c` Turtle):
   - Similar to Radha, Krishna's face and features are drawn.
   - The turtle `c` is used for this purpose.
   - Krishna's eyes, nose, and mouth are depicted using a range of line widths and angles, similar to Radha.
   - The peacock feather on Krishna's head is another highlight, with beautiful curvature and detail.

4. **Drawing Decorative Patterns** (`d` Turtle):
   - The `d` turtle is responsible for drawing intricate decorative patterns surrounding Radha and Krishna.
   - These patterns include a beautifully detailed border around the entire artwork, created using lines, arcs, and curves.

5. **Displaying the Name** (`name_turtle`):
   - A separate turtle, `name_turtle`, is used to display the name "Raj Mahesh P" in red.
   - The text is positioned at the bottom right corner of the drawing.

6. **Closing the Drawing**:
   - After all the elements are drawn and displayed, the code includes a `time.sleep(120)` command to keep the drawing window open for 120 seconds (2 minutes). This allows you to view the artwork.
   - After the specified time, the drawing window is closed using `turtle.bye()`.
